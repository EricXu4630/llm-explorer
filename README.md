# Thin Harness, Fat Skills

> How much agent orchestration can you get from the LLM provider APIs alone — with almost no scaffolding?

This repo is an answer to that question. It's a multi-provider agent harness for Anthropic, OpenAI, and Gemini that delegates everything possible to the provider APIs and measures what's left.

**The result:** ~550 lines of code that actually *execute* anything. The rest is just wiring.

---

## Motivation

Modern LLM providers — Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini — have quietly built most of what an "agent framework" provides directly into their APIs: web search, code execution, persistent containers, filesystem access, URL fetching, image generation, MCP connectors, Skills APIs, memory tools, advisor models. Most agent frameworks re-implement these at the application layer, adding thousands of lines of scaffolding on top of capabilities the API already provides natively.

This project tests the limits of that premise. Build the thinnest possible wrapper. See how far the raw APIs take you.

## What the provider handles (you just configure it)

| Capability | Anthropic | OpenAI | Gemini |
|---|---|---|---|
| Web search | `web_search_20260209` | `web_search_preview` | Google Search grounding |
| Code / bash execution | `code_execution_20250825` — bash+Python, 30d container | `code_interpreter` + `shell` — Python + bash, `/mnt/data` | Python stateless |
| URL fetch | `web_fetch_20260209` | — | `url_context` |
| Image generation | — | `image_generation` (gpt-image-2) | — |
| Maps | — | — | `google_maps` |
| MCP tool calls | Native API, server-side | Native API, server-side | — |
| Skills (SKILL.md) | Native Skills API, progressive disclosure | `shell.environment.skills` | system prompt injection |
| Memory tool | `memory_20250818` | — | — |
| Advisor (Sonnet→Opus) | `advisor_20260301` beta | — | — |
| Cross-session persistence | `container_id` (30d) + Files API (∞) | `previous_response_id` (30d) + Conversations API (∞) | local disk only |
| Context window | 1M tokens (Opus/Sonnet) | 1M (gpt-5.5), 128K others | 1M+ all 2.5/3 models |

## What the harness does (~550 lines that actually execute)

| File | Lines | What it executes |
|---|---|---|
| `memory_manager.py` | ~250 | Reads/writes `memories/` when model calls `memory_20250818` |
| `workspace_executor.py` | ~300 | Runs bash commands in `workspace/` for Gemini |
| everything else | ~2,900 | Routing, config forwarding, UI, session persistence — nothing executed |

The three provider wrappers (`providers/*.py`, ~1,075 lines combined) are pure API forwarding. They build the request, stream the response, and relay events to the frontend. They don't execute tools.

## Features

- **Chat UI** with provider toggle (Anthropic / OpenAI / Gemini) and model selector
- **API Inspector** — every raw request and response, human-readable summary + collapsible raw JSON
- **Tool cards** — real-time visibility into which tools fired, with inputs shown
- **MCP connector** — add any public MCP server URL; Anthropic and OpenAI call it natively
- **Skills** — load any SKILL.md from a GitHub URL; uploaded once, `skill_id` cached
- **AGENTS.md** — static system prompt loaded on every call; `memories/AGENTS.md` is model-writable
- **API key input** — enter keys in the UI sidebar, stored in `localStorage`; no `.env` required for users
- **Resizable panels** — drag handles between sidebar, chat, and inspector
- **About page** — reference tables for all capabilities, tool routing, file structure, model list

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EricXu4630/llm-explorer
cd llm-explorer
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8080 --reload
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8080`. Enter your API key in the Provider panel on the left. No `.env` needed — keys are stored in your browser's `localStorage`.

**Optional `.env` for server-side keys:**
```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIza...
```

```

## AGENTS.md and memory

`AGENTS.md` is the static system prompt loaded on every call. You edit it to define the agent's role and behavior.

`memories/AGENTS.md` is written by the model using the `memory_20250818` tool (Anthropic). It accumulates facts, preferences, and context across sessions. The model reads it at session start.

Cross-session flow:
```
model calls memory tool → harness writes memories/AGENTS.md
next session → model reads /memories → picks up where it left off
```

---

## Skills (SKILL.md standard)

Load any skill from a GitHub URL in the sidebar. The harness zips the SKILL.md and uploads it to the provider's Skills API. After the first upload, only the `skill_id` is sent — the full content is never in the request again.

- **Anthropic + OpenAI**: native Skills API with progressive disclosure (L1: name only, L2: full content on trigger, L3: bundled resources)
- **Gemini**: no native Skills API — full content injected into system prompt

## Deployment

Configured for Railway (`Procfile` + `railway.toml` included). Set API keys as environment variables in the Railway dashboard.

```
web: uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
```

Note: Railway has an ephemeral filesystem — `memories/`, `workspace/`, and `sessions/` reset on redeploy. Add a persistent volume or database if you need cross-deploy memory.
